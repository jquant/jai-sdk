   JAI is the easiest way for developers to build, publish and integrate AI solutions

  Made for developers of all levels of expertise – even if they aren’t data scientists

  Scalable models up and running in minutes, not months
  Works reliably with real-world, messy data

  Allows easy integration across different technology stacks

  JAI accomplishes this mission by:

• Simplifying the complex, messy world of data science in three simple methods

• Providing simple methods for building and integrating AI solutions.

• Enabling end-users to conjugate multimodal data sources (text, images, and tabular) and build solutions even with little machine learning knowledge

• Enabling data sharing without compromising confidentiality through meaningful vector sharing (a structure that encrypts the data without the possibility of reconstructing the original information)

• No rewriting code from scratch (check dio's link).
