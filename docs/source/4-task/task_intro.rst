Introducion - Task Module
#########################

The task module was designed to give a new experience to consuming the Jai API.
As our API grew in complexity, the original Jai class also grew full of methods to achieve various possible goals. 
Because of that, the experience for a new user got very overwhelming.

In an attempt to shorten the learning curve, we divided the many possible tasks into their own individual classes. 
Now, the user can focus on learning one task at a time without the noise of the others.
