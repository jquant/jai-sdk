The task module was designed to give a new experience to consuming the Jai API.
As our API grew in complexity, the original Jai class also grew full of methods to achieve various possible goals. 
Because of that, the experience for a new user got very overwhelming.

We divided the many possible tasks into their own individual classes aiming to shorten the learning curve. 
Now, the user can focus on learning one task at a time without the noise of the methods of the other tasks.

- :ref:`Explorer Module <source/4-task/explorer:explorer module>`

- :ref:`Trainer Module <source/4-task/trainer:trainer module>`

- :ref:`Query Module <source/4-task/query:query module>`

- :ref:`Vectors Module <source/4-task/vectors:vectors module>`

- :ref:`Linear Models Module <source/4-task/linear:linear module>`


Those are an alternative to consuming the API, Jai class is still available for use. 
We have no plans of deprecating either in the near future.
Nevertheless, we'll take the necessary actions as we progress with the development of the SDK.
